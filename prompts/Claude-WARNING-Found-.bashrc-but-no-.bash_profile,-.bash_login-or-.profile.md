WARNING: Found ~/.bashrc but no ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login or ~/.profile.


This warning indicates you need to set up your bash profile. In Git Bash on Windows, we should create a .bash_profile that sources .bashrc:

Create .bash_profile:
bash

Copy
touch ~/.bash_profile
Add this content to .bash_profile:
bash

Copy
echo 'if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
Verify both files exist:
bash

Copy
ls -la ~ | grep bash
Source the new profile:
bash

Copy
source ~/.bash_profile
The difference between these files:

.bash_profile is executed for login shells
.bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells
On Windows/Git Bash, we want both, with .bash_profile loading .bashrc
Now rbenv should work properly. You can verify with:

bash

Copy
rbenv -v
If you're still having issues, we can verify the content of both files:

bash

Copy
cat ~/.bash_profile
cat ~/.bashrc
Copy
Retry
