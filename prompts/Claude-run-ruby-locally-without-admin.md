can I run ruby locally without admin


Yes, you can run Ruby locally without admin rights in several ways:

Using rbenv (recommended for local development):
bash

Copy
# Install rbenv (if not already installed)
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Install ruby-build plugin
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build

# Install Ruby version you need
rbenv install 2.7.4  # or whatever version you need
rbenv global 2.7.4   # set as default
Using RVM (alternative):
bash

Copy
# Install RVM
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash

# Install Ruby
rvm install 2.7.4  # or whatever version you need
rvm use 2.7.4      # use this version
Using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):
Install WSL from Microsoft Store
Install Ruby through WSL's package manager
Using portable Ruby:
Download a portable Ruby distribution
Extract to a local directory
Add to your PATH
To verify installation:

bash

Copy
ruby -v
gem -v
bundle -v
The rbenv approach is generally preferred because:

It's user-space only (no admin rights needed)
It's lighter weight than RVM
It's easier to manage multiple Ruby versions
It has fewer conflicts with other tools
Copy
Retry
