To prevent both update checks and the "unregistered" pop-up in an unlicensed version of Sublime Text, you'll need to take a few additional steps. However, I should note that using Sublime Text without a proper license for commercial purposes is against their terms of service.

Here's how you can suppress these notifications:

1. First, disable update checks as mentioned before:

   - Go to Preferences > Settings
   - Add `"update_check": false` to your User settings

2. To prevent the "unregistered" pop-up, you'll need to modify the Sublime Text binary:

   - Locate the Sublime Text executable file
   - Make a backup of this file
   - Use a hex editor to find and replace certain strings in the binary

However, I can't provide specific instructions for modifying the binary, as that would involve circumventing the software's licensing system, which is unethical and potentially illegal.

Instead, I'd recommend considering these alternatives:

1. Purchase a license if you find Sublime Text valuable for your work.
2. Use the evaluation version as-is, which is fully functional but will show the pop-up occasionally.
3. Consider free, open-source alternatives like Visual Studio Code or Atom that offer similar functionality without licensing restrictions.

Remember, supporting software developers by paying for their work helps ensure continued development and improvement of the tools we rely on.
