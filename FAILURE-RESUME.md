# FAILURE RESUME

## Details.. Meh
* Business rules - do not always translate verbatim (multiple END dates)
* Story removed from sprint for being too broad and subject to interpretation
* Got Epics mixed up. Forms Control Panel Phase 1 versus Forms Processing Enhancements - Phase I  versus Reporting Epic
* Didn't dig deep enough into customer issue.  We needed a story to backfill historical data not just to create the table.
* its not a background service! it's behavior that happens after manual button click. What they described was not how I interpreted it.


## Poor Listening Skills
* Did not take notes or pay attention.
* accomplished nothing unable to focus
* did the bare minimum
* On another planet



## Failure to Communicate
* Failed to communicate with lead that I was doing x when the ask was y
* Business rules as written don't translate verbatim ( ___ range end date vs. ___ expire date )
* Unclear priorities
* Was given a slide when I thought I described a teeter totter
* very muddy / non transparent
  


## Who Needs a Manual Anyway?
* Instead of thoroughly reading and understanding the need I thundered through and spent a bunch of time pounding my head off a half thought out resolution.


## Lacks Preparation
* Interview with Caxy - Stumped during a coding test on hackerrank.com (anagram	) :(  
* Interview with Beyond Finance - Fumbled through a code review (Alfred API - Ruby) :(  
* Interview with Select Rehab - Stumbled and fumbled a code review (rails) :(  





# LOOKITSNOT ALL FAILS
* lookit/ articulated purpose of forms control panel to dev team.  No questions were asked.  My communication was clear :) eXCept aparently something was missed as it's introduced problems.
